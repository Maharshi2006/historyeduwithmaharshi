          Red Fort (Lal Qila) - A Symbol of India&#039;s History and Power
          <br />
          The Red Fort (Lal Qila) is one of India’s most significant historical
          monuments. It was the main residence of the Mughal emperors for nearly
          200 years and is now a symbol of India&#039;s rich past and its
          independence.

          Historical Background
          <br />
          The Red Fort was commissioned by Shah Jahan in 1638, after he decided to
          move his capital from Agra to Delhi. It was completed in 1648 and became
          the political and cultural center of the Mughal Empire. The fort
          remained under Mughal rule until 1857, when the British took control
          after the Indian Rebellion of 1857.

            Originally White: Some historical reports suggest that the fort was
            initially covered in white limestone, but over time, it was painted

            Peacock Throne: The fort once housed the Peacock Throne, embedded with
